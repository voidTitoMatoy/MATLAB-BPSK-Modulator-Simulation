# MATLAB-BPSK-Modulator-Simulation
This repository contains the MATLAB code for the both the simulation of an ideal balanced modulator and of a BPSK complex envelope generator with and without the use of the built in function pskmod().

The authors' implementation of the BPSK complex envelope generator performs similarly to pskmod() through similar BER.
